## Introduction
This is a code repository for the hulu clone app for dispaying movies by categories. It mainly focuses on the front end part of the application. 

I have used create-next-app for scaffolding the project. The libraries and packages I have used in the project include: @heroicons/react for displaying the used icons, react-flip-move, a module to tackle the common but arduous problem of animating a list of items when the list's order changes, tailwind-scrollbar-hide used to hide scrollbar.

## Setup:
- clone the repository from `https://github.com/kmwangemi/hulu-2.git`
- Move to the folder and open the project in your favorite editor
- Create a .env.local file 
- Add your tmdb api in the following format: API_KEY="xxx...."
- run ```npm i && npm run dev or yarn dev```
